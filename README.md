# Local Library
This is a take-home project for engineering applicants at HockeyStack, inspired by [MDN's tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website).

----

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.
## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:

1. Set up a [Node.js](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment) development environment and install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Once you have the files in your local environment, enter the following commands in the root of your repo:
   ```
   npm install
   nodemon app.js
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000/ to reach the library site.

> **Note:** The library uses a default MongoDb database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). You should use a different database for your own code experiments.
